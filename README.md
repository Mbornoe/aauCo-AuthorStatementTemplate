# aauCo-AuthorStatementTemplate
On this page, I have  published a Latex template version of the Co-author Statement in Connection with Submission of a PhD Thesis. The template is bascially a latex version of the [word version]{https://www.phd.tech.aau.dk/digitalAssets/178/178556_medforfattermarts2014.doc}. It is primarily intended for use by other people studying or working at Aalborg University (AAU), but everyone is encouraged to use the templates.
